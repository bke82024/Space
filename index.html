            <p>
              Size: The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of our
              solar system. It's around 109 times the diameter of Earth!
            </p>
            <p>
              Core Temperature: The temperature at the core of the Sun is around
              15 million°C (27 million°F), where nuclear fusion occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distance from Earth: The Sun is approximately 93 million miles
              (150 million kilometers) away from Earth, a distance known as 1
              Astronomical Unit (AU).
            </p>
            <p>
              Sun's Age: The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is
              considered a "middle-aged" star. It’s expected to burn for another
              5 billion years before evolving into a red giant.

              Mercury has extreme temperature fluctuations: Because it has
              almost no atmosphere to retain heat, temperatures on Mercury can
              vary dramatically. During the day, the temperature can soar to
              800°F (427°C), while at night, it can plummet to a frigid -330°F
              (-201°C). This extreme variation happens because the planet has a
              very slow rotation and no protective atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              A year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days: Mercury is the fastest
              planet in the solar system, orbiting the Sun in just 88 Earth
              days. This means a year on Mercury is less than three months long!
            </p>
            <p>
              A day on Mercury is longer than its year: Mercury's rotation is
              very slow. It takes 59 Earth days to complete one full rotation on
              its axis. So, while it takes just 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun,
              it takes almost 60 Earth days for one full day-night cycle on the
              planet!

              Venus is the hottest planet: Despite being second from the Sun,
              Venus has the highest surface temperature in the solar system,
              reaching up to 900°F (475°C), which is hotter than Mercury, the
              planet closest to the Sun. This is due to its thick atmosphere of
              carbon dioxide, which traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              A day on Venus is longer than a year: Venus has an extremely slow
              rotation. It takes about 243 Earth days for Venus to complete one
              full rotation on its axis, but only 225 Earth days to orbit the
              Sun. This means a day on Venus (from one sunrise to the next) is
              longer than its year!
            </p>
            <p>
              Venus is Earth's "sister planet": Venus and Earth are often called
              "sister planets" because they are similar in size, mass, and
              composition. However, Venus has a much more extreme environment,
              with crushing atmospheric pressure, sulfuric acid clouds, and
              intense heat.

              Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the
              Noachian period (4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago), Mars's surface was
              marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the
              possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period (3.5 to
              3.3–2.9 billion years ago) was dominated by widespread volcanic
              activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The
              Amazonian period, which continues to the present, has been marked
              by the wind as a dominant influence on geological processes. Due
              to Mars's geological history, the possibility of past or present
              life on Mars remains of great scientific interest.

              Rings: Saturn's rings are made of billions of chuncks of ice and

              to be asteroids that broke up before they reached the planet due

            </p>
            <p>
              Distance from sun: Saturn is about 1427 million kilometers far

              Ice giant: Uranus beside Neptun is one of the two ice giants in

              Distance to sun: The distance between Uranus and the Sun is about
              19 Astronomical units (AU), while one AU is the distance from the

              Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh, making it by
              far the first known object in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately
              hailed as the ninth planet, but it never fit well with the other
              eight, and its planetary status was questioned when it was found
              to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following
              the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in
              the 1990s, and particularly the more massive scattered disk object
              Eris in 2005. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU)
              formally redefined the term planet to exclude dwarf planets such
              as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to
              consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.
